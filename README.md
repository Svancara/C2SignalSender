# Collective2 Signal Sender

A simple solution how to prepare and send several signals to Collective2.  

Say you want to send 10-20 trading signals to Collective2.

You know your symbols, prices, stop-loss and profit-target limits, parking times, etc.

You want to prepare a list of signals in advance (off-line) without any stress and to send signals in appropriate times just clicking on them.
